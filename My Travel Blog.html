<h1>Welcome to My Travel Blog</h1>
<h2>Singapore</h2>
<p>My family and I went to Singapore for a week. The Singapore Airport, The Changi Airport was the prettiest and the most unique airport I've ever seen.</p>
<h2>Gardens By The Bay</h2>
<p>On the first day, we were pretty tired from all the travelling. So we went to Gardens By The Bay. It was pretty huge and a lot to see. We first went to the flower section. Variety of flowers in different colours were nice to see. There was even a waterfall inside the building. Next we went to the transformers sections. Me and my brother really enjoyed this one. Cool robots and gadjets were so fun to watch. We clicked many pictures and then headed out. By this time we were pretty hungry, so we grabbed something to eat and waited for the light show to start. We got a nice spot in the big garden where we laid down and watched the light show which was very cool! After that we headed to our hotel.</p>
<h2>Shopping</h2>
<p>We had nothing to do today. so we decided to roam around in the malls and maybe shop a little. There was a famous mall near our hotel so we decided to go there first. The mall was huge and so much better. We got some clothes, shoes and other things from there. On our way we saw a popular chinese restaraunt. So we stopped there to get lunch. I got my favourite, Sushi and noodles. The food was absolutely delicious. We roamed around a bit more and then got some ice cream on our was back. Another thing I liked was that there were many vending machines. Me and brother loved taking from the vending machines. Our hotel even had one on each level. We got dinner at our hotel which was really good too.</p>
<h2>Flyer and Night Safari</h2>
<p>The next day, we got ready for the flyer. but before that we went to a massive building which had like 50 floors or maybe more! There was a big boat like structure on top of the builidng. The view from up there was soo exciting and fun to watch! We took some pictured there and got slushies from the shops there. We still had time before the flyer started so we took bikerides beside a beautiful lake. Me and my brother even cycled on the F1 race track, which was currently not fully made. Finally we got gelatos after the bike ride and went to the flyer. The flyer was like a really big ferris wheel which went up slowly so that we could enjoy the view. It went sooo high and it was realy fun. There were spacious capsules which were pretty big and private so it was just us. Again we clicked many pictures as the view so very beutiful from the top. Now we went to get food at the night safari camp as it was just about to start. Tje food there was good too. Our jeep arrived and we went into the zoo. There we saw lions, tigers, deers, rhinos and many more animals. Some boars were raoming free on the tracks. We decided to have a closer look at the lions so we went on foot. When we were watching the lions one of them got up and roared loudly! I've never seen them roar and i was so happy I got the chance to see it. Then we saw some snakes and reptiles and after that our jeep took us back. It was a really fun experience.</p>
<h2>Universal Studios</h2>
<p>Universal Studios was by far the most fun I had. There i rode my first roller coaster! Also the best part was that me and my brother got first row seats! My first roller coaster that too on the first row was so thrilling! I was more excited but scared too. But i ended up enjoying it a lot! We went to quite a few rides there too. We went to many shows and games too. And of course we couldnt miss the parade! It was sooo coool! All the characters together performing and stuff was fun to watch. We got some things from the souvenier shops as well. I got some pics with some of the characters and we stopped to get some food there which was as usual veryyy delicious. And then we ate out at a restaraunt and got to the hotel very tired.</p>
<h2>Jurong Bird Park</h2>
<p>We got up in the morning and went to the famous shops there. I've got to say, 7 eleven was amazing and the variety of food was so yummyy! We got some noodles for lunch and then went to our hotel for the taxi to pick us up. We went to jurong bird park. It was a long walk but definately worth it because I got to feed the birds myself. I was expecting that they wouldnt come but many of them did and they were on my head hands and shoulder. I really like animals so I was more than happy to be able to experince this. We went to visit every bird there and I even got some trained parakeets to do tricks with me! I was beaming with happiness and I loved doing this. I wish i come here everyday. Anyways, we had dinner and then went back to the hotel.</p>
<h2>Sentosa Island</h2>
<p>Sentosa island was like another theme park with rides and games. We got there by ziplines with domes so we could sit. It was pretty fun and when we reached there so many rides were there and we wanted to go on all of them. The rides were so much fun. This one ride THE RETURN OF THE MUMMY was soo good I had to go thrice. Got some starbucks because we were feeling the need to drink something. Again got some snacks there. The potato swirls there were too good. The poeple there were well mannered and polite. This was the last thing to do was i was kinda sad. But I had a really good time there and I wouldn't miss a chance to go there again!</p>
